###  Set up
yarn install to install dependencies

If you don't have yarn installed locally,
please refer to this documentation (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

After yarn install, run yarn start, this will open the application on
http://localhost:5000

###  Notes
The app uses React as front end framework. There are 2 main components,
a stateful one app.js and a stateless one form.js.

### What would I have done better.
